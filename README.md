# RESTful_API_JScript_For_YouTube

If you have not used the YouTube Data API before, these are some JavaScript code snippets I have used to setup searches and video streaming for sites I have created in the past.

There are quite a few different ways to integrate the YouTube API, but they all align with RESTful format.

Here I use the setting_API_key.js code to setup the unique identifier key needed to interface with YouTube. I am using JSON calls

Although I'm just doing a search here, you can use the YouTube reference Data API site (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/)  to use other features for your video integration (ie. streaming, playback speed, time segmenting,...etc.)
